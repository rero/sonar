      <p>SONAR is an archive of scholarly publications. It intends to collect, promote and preserve the publications of authors affiliated with Swiss public research institutions.</p>
      <p>It acts as an aggregator, by bringing together the content and metadata of existing platforms and servers, including the institutional repositories (IR) of Swiss institutions of higher education, as well as international subject repositories. It also operates as a content disseminator: both to Swiss IRs and to the Web at large, namely to search engines of scholarly literature such as Google Scholar and Microsoft Academic.</p>
      <p>Besides the automated harvesting service, interested Swiss universities can subscribe to an outsourced institutional repository service so that their author can directly deposit publications in SONAR.</p>
      <p>SONAR contributes to the Swiss national Open Access strategy and its action plan, lead by swissuniversities.</p>
