SONAR is an archive of scholarly publications. It intends to collect, promote
and preserve the publications of authors affiliated with Swiss public research
institutions.

It acts as an aggregator, by bringing together the content and metadata of
existing platforms and servers, including the institutional repositories (IR)
of Swiss institutions of higher education, as well as international subject
repositories. It also operates as a content disseminator: both to Swiss IRs
and to the Web at large, namely to search engines of scholarly literature such
as Google Scholar and Microsoft Academic.

Besides the automated harvesting service, interested Swiss universities can
subscribe to an outsourced institutional repository service so that their
author can directly deposit publications in SONAR.

SONAR contributes to the Swiss national Open Access strategy and its action
plan, lead by swissuniversities.
